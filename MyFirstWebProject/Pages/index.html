		Today’s turbulent economic and business environment has forced firms to seek ways to 
		remain relevant in their industry by being more flexible, adaptive and consequently competitive 
		in order to survive the rapidly changing markets (Sigh, 2009). In view of the above premise,
		the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of employee participation on decision making
		and organizational performance in manufacturing firms in Nigeria. It might be expected that being 
		involved in decision-making will be challenging for many employees and that at the same time it 
		might increase their motivation toward work (Ladd and Marshall 2004). Harber, Marriot and Idrus (1991),
		for illustration, employee participation is now considered a key element in the successful implementation
		of new management strategies and plays an important role in determining the degree of organizational 
		performance (Harmon et al., 2003; Zainnudin & Isa, 2011). However, participative decision-making (PDM) 
		has attracted academic attention in the last 20 years (Kim 2002; Ladd & Marshall, 2004). Furthermore, it 
		has been argued that participative decision-making is an element vital to improving organizational performance 
		in an organizations.

 <p> Employee participation is considered as key element in the successful implementation of new decision making 
	strategies and plays an important role in determining the degree of organizational performance (Ardichvili, 
	Page et al., 2003). Furthermore, participation is a mental and emotional reflection that will lead to the 
	fulfillment of individual and organizational goals, especially if supported by the organization’s climate 
	(Ardichvili, Page et al., 2003).  Komal (2013) believes that worker participation is merely a managerial 
	technique that can be used effectively in certain situations. Cadwallader et al. (2010) found that several 
	variables determine the relationship between employees’ participation in decision-making with organizational 
	performance, including well-organized teamwork, good communication, etc.
